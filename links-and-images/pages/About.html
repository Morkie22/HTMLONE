    <h1>About Page</h1>
    <p>Colombian culture is a vibrant tapestry woven from the diverse threads of its indigenous,<br>
         African, and Spanish heritage. This rich cultural blend is reflected in the country's music, dance, art, and cuisine. <br>
         Colombia is renowned for its colorful festivals, such as the Carnival of Barranquilla, which showcases a spectacular array <br>
          of dances and musical styles, including cumbia and vallenato, symbols of the nation's cultural diversity.<br>
           Colombian literature has gained international acclaim, most notably through the works of Gabriel García Márquez,<br>
            who introduced the world to Magical Realism. The Colombian cuisine, characterized by dishes like arepas and bandeja paisa, offers a taste of its regional diversity. <br>
            Hospitality and family are central to Colombian culture, emphasizing warmth, generosity, and a sense of community. <br>
            Amidst its geographical beauty, from lush rainforests to majestic mountains, Colombia's greatest treasure is its resilient <br>
            and welcoming people, who embody the vibrant spirit of their cultural heritage.
